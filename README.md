## UX and Design

In this section is a discussion on the User Experiance and design of the Website.  Website is catering for tourist visits to the Highlands so this was the focus of the design.  Images and information was tailored to be highland specific.  A particular emphasis was put on images as these would be used to sell the locations as well as the company. 

### Site wide

#### Navigation 
The first thing necessary for this website was a good navigation system for moving around easily.  To accomplish this the **Bootstrap nav classes** where used.  These provided a minimalist yet effective nav bar at the top of all site pages.  

Navigation features: 
 * Company Logo (Setup as a Nav link to home page)
 * Nav links
    * Home page 
    * Trek page 
    * Book page

For design the navbar used a minimal one lighter color style with white letters. The color chosen was the **primary colour** (see color section) with white lettering to make it easier for users to see.  For further ease in user experiance each page contains a class of:

```html
    class = "nav-active"
```
If the user is currently on the specific page the nav item is referring to. 

Or

```html
    class = "nav-inactive"
```
If the user is not on the page specified by the nav item.

These are for easy identification of the page the user is currently on.
#### Index

The main page of the website is the **index.html** document.
